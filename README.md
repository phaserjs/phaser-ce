# Phaser CE (Community Edition) - HTML5 Game Framework

<img src="http://phaser.io/images/github/arcade-cab.png" align="right">

Phaser is a fast, free, and fun open source HTML5 game framework. It uses a custom build of [Pixi.js](https://github.com/GoodBoyDigital/pixi.js/) for WebGL and Canvas rendering, and supports desktop and mobile web browsers. Games can be compiled to iOS, Android and native desktop apps via 3rd party tools. You can use JavaScript or TypeScript for development. Years after release, Phaser is still one of the [most starred game frameworks](https://github.com/showcases/javascript-game-engines) on GitHub.

Thousands of developers worldwide use Phaser. From indies and multi-national digital agencies, to schools and Universities. Each creating their own incredible [games](http://phaser.io/games/).

Phaser v2 was originally built and maintained by the company [Photon Storm](http://www.photonstorm.com), but was turned over to the community in November 2016. [Phaser v3](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/tree/master/v3) is in active development.

The [current Phaser CE release is 2.7.10](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser-ce/releases/tag/v2.7.10).

## What's New

### 23rd March 2017

[Phaser CE](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser-ce) is the Community Edition of [Phaser](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser). In short, it's a version of Phaser that you, the community, have direct control over.

It was started with the 2.7.0 release and since then the community has worked to continue updating it, fixing bugs and adding new features.

Phaser 2 was a massive milestone for us, and we're still constantly amazed at all the cool things you created, and continue to create with it. Thank you to everyone who has submitted an issue or pull request over the years, or helped the framework grow in any shape or capacity.

As of today all of our in-house resources are spent on building Phaser 3 and beyond. However we fully recognize that lots of you still use Phaser 2, and have a lot to contribute to its future. So this is what we've done:

* [Phaser 2.6.2](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/releases/tag/v2.6.2) is the last 'official' release, published on npm as [phaser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/phaser)
* [Phaser 2.7.0 and all future versions](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser-ce/releases) have been given to the community to maintain, published on npm as [phaser-ce](https://www.npmjs.com/package/phaser-ce)

**All Pull Requests made against this repo will be unconditionally approved**.

We'll give GitHub permissions to a select few individuals to help with this process if they request them. And when you, the community, request it, we will publish new versions to npm.

We believe this set-up will give us the best of both worlds. It will allow us to continue focusing our efforts on Phaser 3. And it will allow the community to enhance Phaser 2 for as long as they wish.

As always, check the [Change Log](#change-log) to see what was added recently.

Keep your eyes on the web site, and subscribe to the weekly Phaser World [newsletter](#newsletter). You can also follow on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/photonstorm), or chat in the Phaser [Slack](http://phaser.io/community/slack) and [Discord](http://phaser.io/community/discord) channels.

There are also now more ways than before to help [support](#support) the development of Phaser. The uptake so far has been fantastic, but this is an on-going mission. Thank you to everyone who supports our development. Who shares our belief in the future of HTML5 gaming, and Phasers role in that.

Happy coding everyone!

Cheers,

Rich - [@photonstorm](https://twitter.com/photonstorm)

## Building Phaser

Phaser is provided ready compiled in the `build` folder of the repository. There are both plain and minified versions. The plain version is for use during development, and the minified version for production. You can also create your own builds.

### Custom Builds

Phaser includes a grunt based build system, which allows you to strip out  features you may not require, saving hundreds of KB in the process. Don't use any Sound in your game? Then exclude the entire sound system. Don't need Keyboard support? That can be excluded too.

As a result of this work the minimum build size of Phaser is now just 80KB minified and gzipped.

See the [Creating a Custom Phaser Build](http://phaser.io/tutorials/creating-custom-phaser-builds) tutorial for details.

<a name="browserify"></a>

### Browserify / CommonJS

Phaser was never written to be modular. Everything exists under one single global namespace, and you cannot `require` selected parts of it into your builds. It expects 3 global vars to exist in order to work properly: `Phaser`, `PIXI` and `p2`. The following is one way of doing this:

```javascript
window.PIXI   = require('phaser-ce/build/custom/pixi');
window.p2     = require('phaser-ce/build/custom/p2');
window.Phaser = require('phaser-ce/build/custom/phaser-split');
```

If you build a custom version of Phaser it will split the 3 core libs out into their own files, allowing you to require them as above.

We appreciate this is just a band-aid, and not a proper use of modules, but please understand it was never built to be used this way. You're trying to fit a square peg in a round browserify-shaped hole, so compromises have to be made. Please don't open GitHub issues about it as we've no intention of changing Phaser at this stage of its life. Full module based development is available in Phaser v3.

### Webpack

As with browserify, use the `pixi`, `p2`, and `phaser-split` modules in [build/custom](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser-ce/tree/master/build/custom). You can then use [expose-loader](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/expose-loader/) to expose them as `PIXI`, `p2`, and `Phaser`.

See [lean/phaser-es6-webpack](https://github.com/lean/phaser-es6-webpack) for a sample configuration.

### Building from source

Should you wish to build Phaser from source you can take advantage of the provided [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) scripts. Ensure you have the required packages by running `npm install` first.

Run `grunt` to perform a default build to the `dist` folder.

### Packaging a new release

Releases of new versions of Phaser CE are under the communities control. If you feel there are sufficient fixes, or important ones that warrant a new version release, then please do the following:

1. Make sure the version number is increased, in line with semver policies, in the following files: `package.json` and `src/Phaser.js`

2. Make sure that you have added details of the new version to the `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`. This should include a summary of changes made in the version. You can usually obtain this from the commit / PR history. It's nice to credit who made the changes by linking to their GitHub user ID, but isn't a requirement.

3. From the root repo folder, run `grunt jshint` and make sure there are no jshint errors. If there are, please fix them, or request that the original author of the code does so.

4. Once jshint passes run `grunt release`, sit back, and wait. It will build all of the versions of Phaser required, update the doc files, TypeScript defs and lots more. When finished, commit all of the new files and make sure to include a clear message in your commit saying you want this release pushed to npm. Be sure to tag me when doing this, i.e. 'Phaser CE Version 2.X.X. Please publish to npm @photonstorm' - I'll see it, and then publish as soon as I can (often the same day).

## Made With Phaser

Thousands of [games](http://phaser.io/news/category/game) have been made in Phaser. From game jam entries, to titles by some of the largest entertainment brands in the world. You can find [hundreds more on our web site](http://phaser.io/games).

We add [new games](http://phaser.io/news/category/game) to the Phaser site weekly, so be sure to send us yours when it's finished!

<a name="requirements"></a>

## Requirements

Phaser requires a web browser that supports the [canvas tag](http://caniuse.com/#feat=canvas). This includes Internet Explorer 9+, Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Opera on desktop. iOS Safari, Android Browser and Chrome for Android are supported on mobile.

While Phaser does its best to ensure a consistent cross-platform experience, always be aware of browser and device limitations. This is especially important with memory and GPU limitations on mobile, and legacy browser HTML5 compatibility.

### IE9

If you need to support IE9 / Android 2.x _and_ use P2 physics, then you must use the polyfill in the `resources/IE9 Polyfill` folder. If you don't use P2 (or don't care about IE9!) you can skip this.

### JavaScript and TypeScript

Phaser is developed in ES5 JavaScript. We've made no assumptions about how you like to code, and were careful not to impose a strict structure upon you. You won't find Phaser split into modules, requiring a build step, or making you use a class / inheritance OOP approach. That doesn't mean you can't do so, it just means we don't _force_ you to. It's your choice.

If you code with [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) there are comprehensive definition files in the `typescript` folder. They are for TypeScript 1.4+.

# Change Log

## Version 2.7.10 - 17th May 2017

### New Features

* You can now set Phaser.Utils.Debug#lineWidth, the width of the stroke on drawn lines and unfilled shapes.

### Updates

* Group#checkProperty now returns false if the `child` argument is not a child of the Group. Use Phaser.Utils.checkProperty instead to check a property value on any object.
* `/docs` and `/resources` were removed from Phaser CE's Bower and NPM packages, which are now much smaller.
* added creature tinting (creature.tint = 0xFF0000 for red tint)
* added creature alpha (creature.alpha = 0.5 for 50% opacity)

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed Group#checkAll and Group#checkProperty returning a false negative when `force` was used (#219).
* Utils.getProperty now returns undefined for missing properties. It had claimed to return null, but could return either null or undefined depending on chain length (#218).
* Fixed Group#checkAll, Group#checkProperty, and Utils.getProperty failing to retrieve nested properties (#220).
* Corrected Group#checkAll and Group#checkProperty argument types (#216).
* Group#getAll was not returning all children objects when property was not specified.
* Emitter#emitParticle apply scale values even when they are identical.

## Version 2.7.9 - 9th May 2017

### Updates

* Emitter#gravity can now be set as a number (as in Phaser versions prior to 2.7.2) or a Point (#203). Reading the value will always give you a Point.

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed a crash when a Text object's alignment was not set (#208).

For changes in previous releases please see the extensive [Version History](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser-ce/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
