This Issue is about (✏️ delete as applicable)

* A bug in the API:
  * Phaser version(s):
  * Live example:
  * What should happen:
  * What happens instead:
* An error in the documentation
* An error in the TypeScript defs
* An error on [phaser.io](http://phaser.io)
* A problem with my own code

API errors must include example code showing what happens, and why you don't believe this is the expected behavior. Issues posted without code take _far_ longer to get resolved, _if ever_.

You can use the [Phaser CE game template](http://codepen.io/pen?template=vyKJvw) or any another service, such as jsbin, to demonstrate the issue. If we can run it and see the error, we can usually fix it.

If your Issue contains _any_ form of hostility it will be instantly closed.

**Be nice. We do this for free.**
